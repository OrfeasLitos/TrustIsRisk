  Centralized reputation systems use stars and reviews and thus require algorithm secrecy to avoid manipulation. In autonomous
  open source decentralized systems this luxury is not available. We create a reputation network for decentralized
  marketplaces where the trust each user gives to the other users is quantifiable and expressed in monetary terms. We
  introduce a new model for bitcoin wallets in which user coins are split among trusted associates. Direct trust is defined
  using shared bitcoin accounts via bitcoin's 1-of-2 multisig. Indirect trust is subsequently defined transitively. This
  enables formal game theoretic arguments pertaining to risk analysis. We prove that risk and maximum flows are equivalent in
  our model and that our system is Sybil-resilient. Our system allows for concrete financial decisions on the subjective
  monetary amount a pseudonymous party can be trusted with. Risk remains invariant under a direct trust redistribution
  operation followed by a purchase.
