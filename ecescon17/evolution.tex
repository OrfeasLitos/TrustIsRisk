\section{Evolution of Trust}
  Trust is Risk is a game that runs indefinitely. In each turn, a player is chosen, decides what to play and, if valid, the
  chosen turn is executed.

  We use $prev\left(j\right)$ to denote the previous turn played by $Player(j)$. If she has not played before,
  $prev\left(j\right) = 0$.

  \noindent Knowledge of the $\mathcal{G}_0$ graph, players' initial capital and the history equal full knowledge of
  the evolution of the game. Building on Fig.~\ref{fig:utxo}, Fig.~\ref{fig:turn} is the result when $D$ plays
  \begin{equation}
  \label{turnexample}
     Turn_1 = \{Steal\left(1, A\right), Add\left(4, C\right), Add\left(-1, B\right)\} \enspace.
  \end{equation}
