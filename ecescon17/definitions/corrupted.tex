\begin{definition}[Corrupted Set]
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph and let Eve have players $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V}$ corrupted, so that she fully
  controls their actions. We call this the corrupted set. The players $\mathcal{B}$ are considered legitimate before the
  corruption, thus they may be directly trusted by any player in $\mathcal{V}$.
\end{definition}
