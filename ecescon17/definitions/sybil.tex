\begin{definition}[Sybil Set]
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ a game graph. Joining is free, so Eve can create unlimited players. These players are the Sybil set,
  $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, Eve fully controls their actions. However, players $\mathcal{C}$ can be directly trusted only by
  players $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$, not by players $\mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$, with
  $\mathcal{B}$ the corrupted set.
\end{definition}
