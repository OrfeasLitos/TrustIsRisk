\section{Further Research}

  %\subsection{Trust Transfer Algorithms}
    When a purchase is made, outgoing direct trust must be reduced such that (\ref{primetrust}) holds. Trust redistribution
    algorithms for this will be discussed in a future paper.

  %\subsection{Dynamic Setting}
    Our game is static. In a future dynamic setting, users should be able to play simultaneously, freely join, depart or
    disconnect temporarily from the network. An interesting analysis would involve modelling repeated purchases with the
    respective edge updates on the trust graph and treating trust on the network as part of the utility function. Other types
    of multisigs, such as 1-of-3, can be explored.

  %\subsection{Zero knowledge}
    MaxFlow in our case needs complete network knowledge, which can lead to privacy issues \cite{deanonymisation}. Calculating
    the flows in zero knowledge remains an open question. SilentWhispers \cite{silentwhispers} and its centralized
    predecessor, PrivPay \cite{privpay}, offer insight into how privacy can be achieved.

  %\subsection{Implementation and Experimental Results}
    A wallet implementation of our game on any blockchain is welcome. Experimental results can be harvested by a simulation or
    implementation of Trust Is Risk. Afterwards, our system can be used in decentralized social networks, such as Synereo
    \cite{synereo}, and other applications.
