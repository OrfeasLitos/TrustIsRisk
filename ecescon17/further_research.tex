\section{Further Research}
  Before a purchase, outgoing direct trust should be reduced as in (\ref{primetrust}). \cite{trustisriskmaster} discusses
  suitable algorithms.

  Our game is static. In a dynamic setting, users will play simultaneously, freely join, depart or disconnect temporarily. In
  a future analysis we will model repeated purchases and treat trust as part of the utility function. 

  MaxFlow now needs full network knowledge, which defeats privacy \cite{deanonymisation}. Calculating the flows in zero
  knowledge remains an open question. \cite{silentwhispers} and \cite{privpay} offer insight into how privacy can be achieved.

  An open source implementation of an API in Bitcoin for OpenBazaar is under development. After deployment, analysis of the
  usage patterns will give insights into the social dynamics Trust is Risk promotes.
