\section{Introduction}
  Online marketplaces can be categorized as centralized and decentralized.
  Two examples of each category are \href{http://www.ebay.com}{ebay} and \href{https://openbazaar.org/}{OpenBazaar}.
  The common denominator of established online marketplaces is that the reputation of each vendor and client is typically
  expressed in the form of stars and user-generated reviews that are viewable by the whole network.

  The goal of ``Trust Is Risk'' is to offer a reputation system for decentralized marketplaces where the trust each user gives
  to the other users is quantifiable in monetary terms. The central assumption used throughout this paper is that trust is
  equivalent to risk, or the proposition that $Alice$'s \textit{trust} in another user $Charlie$ is defined as the
  \textit{maximum sum of money} $Alice$ can lose when $Charlie$ is free to choose any strategy. To flesh out this concept, we
  will use \textit{lines of credit} as proposed by Sanchez \cite{loc}. $Alice$ joins the network by explicitly entrusting some
  money to another user, say her friend, $Bob$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:bottleneckA} and~\ref{fig:bottleneckB}). If $Bob$ has
  already entrusted some money to a third user, $Charlie$, then $Alice$ indirectly trusts $Charlie$ since if the latter wished
  to play unfairly, he could have already stolen the money entrusted to him by $Bob$. We will later see that $Alice$ can now
  engage in economic interaction with $Charlie$.

  To implement lines-of-credit, we use Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin}, a decentralized cryptocurrency that differs from conventional
  currencies in that it does not depend on trusted third parties. All transactions are public as they are recorded on a
  decentralized ledger, the blockchain. Each transaction takes some coins as input and produces some coins as output. If the
  output of a transaction is not connected to the input of another one, then this output belongs to the UTXO, the set of
  unspent transaction outputs. Intuitively, the UTXO contains all coins not yet spent.

  \noindent We propose a new kind of wallet where coins are not exclusively owned, but are placed in shared accounts materialized
  through 1-of-2 multisigs, a bitcoin construct that permits any one of two pre-designated users to spend the coins contained
  within a shared account \cite{masteringbitcoin}. We use the notation 1/$\{Alice, Bob\}$ to represent a 1-of-2 multisig that
  can be spent by either $Alice$ or $Bob$. In this notation, the order of names is irrelevant, as either user can spend.
  However, the user who deposits the money initially into the shared account is relevant -- she is the one risking her money.

  Our approach changes the user experience in a subtle but drastic way. A user no more has to base her trust towards a
  store on stars or ratings which are not expressed in financial units. She can simply consult her wallet to decide whether
  the store is trustworthy and, if so, up to what value, denominated in bitcoin. This system works as follows: Initially
  $Alice$ migrates her funds from her private bitcoin wallet to 1-of-2 multisig addresses shared with friends she
  comfortably trusts. We call this direct trust. Our system is agnostic to the means players use to determine who is
  trustworthy for these direct 1-of-2 deposits. Nevertheless, these deposits contain an objective value visible to the network
  that can be used to deterministically evaluate subjective indirect trust towards other users.

  Suppose $Alice$ is viewing the listings of vendor $Charlie$. Instead of his stars, $Alice$ sees a positive value calculated
  by her wallet representing the maximum value she can safely pay to purchase from $Charlie$. This value, known as indirect
  trust, is calculated in Theorem~\ref{trustflow} -- Trust Flow. Indirect trust towards a user is not global but subjective;
  each user views a personalized indirect trust based on the network topology.  The indirect trust reported by our system
  maintains the following desired security property: If $Alice$ makes a purchase from $Charlie$, then she is exposed to no
  more risk than she was already taking willingly. The existing voluntary risk is exactly that which $Alice$ was taking by
  sharing her coins with her trusted friends. We prove this in Theorem~\ref{riskinv} -- Risk Invariance. Obviously it is not
  safe for $Alice$ to buy anything from any vendor if she has not directly entrusted any value to other users.

  In Trust Is Risk the money is not invested at the time of purchase and directly to the vendor, but at an earlier point in
  time and only to parties that are trustworthy for out of band reasons. The fact that this system can function in a
  completely decentralized fashion will become clear in the following sections. We prove this in Theorem~\ref{sybil} -- Sybil
  Resilience.

  We make the design choice that an entity can express her trust maximally in terms of her available capital. Thus, an
  impoverished player cannot allocate much direct trust to her friends, no matter how trustworthy they are. On the other hand,
  a rich player may entrust a small fraction of her funds to a player that she does not extensively trust and still exhibit
  more direct trust than the impoverished player. There is no upper limit to trust; each player is only limited by her funds.
  We thus take advantage of the following remarkable property of money: To normalise subjective human preferences into
  objective value.

  A user has several incentives to join. First, she has access to otherwise inaccessible stores. Moreover, two friends can
  formalize their mutual trust by directly entrusting the same amount to each other. A company that casually subcontracts
  others can express its trust towards them. Governments can choose to directly entrust citizens with money and confront them
  using a corresponding legal arsenal if they make irresponsible use of this trust. Banks can provide loans as outgoing and
  manage savings as incoming direct trust. Last, the network is an investment and speculation field since it constitutes a new
  area for financial activity.

  Observe that the same physical person can maintain multiple pseudonymous identities in the same trust network and that
  multiple independent trust networks for different purposes can coexist. \ifdefined\proceedings \else On the other hand, the
  same pseudonymous identity can be used to establish trust in different contexts.\fi

  Trust Is Risk is not just a theoretical conception, but can be deployed and applied in existing decentralized markets such
  as OpenBazaar. All the necessary bitcoin constructs such as multisigs are readily available. Our only concern pertains to
  the scalability of such an implementation, but we are confident that such difficulties can be overcome.
