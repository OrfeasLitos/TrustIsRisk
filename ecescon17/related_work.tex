\section{Related Work}
  Webs-of-trust can be used as a basis for trust as shown by Caronni \cite{wot}. PGP \cite{pgp} implements one and Pathfinder
  \cite{pathfinder} explores its transitive closure. Freenet \cite{freenet} implements a transitive web-of-trust for fighting
  spam. Mui et al. \cite{mui} and J\o{}sang et al. \cite{beta} propose ways of calculating trust towards distant nodes.
  Vi\c{s}an et al. \cite{vpc} calculate trust in a hierarchical way. CA- and Byzantine-based \cite{byzantine} PKIs \cite{pki}
  and Bazaar \cite{bazaar} require central trusted third parties or at least authenticated membership. FIRE \cite{fire}, CORE
  \cite{core}, Gr\"unert et al. \cite{ghkkw} and Repantis et al. \cite{rk} do not prove any Sybil resilience. All these
  systems define trust in a non-financial manner.

  We agree with Gollmann \cite{badtrust} in that the meaning of trust should not be extrapolated. We adopted their advice and
  urge our readers to adhere to the definitions of \textit{direct} and \textit{indirect} trust as defined here.

  Beaver \cite{beaver} includes a trust model that, to discourage Sybil attacks, relies on fees, something we chose to avoid.
  Our motivating application for exploring trust in a decentralized setting is OpenBazaar, where transitive financial trust
  has previously been explored by Zindros \cite{dionyziz}. That work however does not define trust as a monetary value. We are
  strongly inspired by Karlan et al. \cite{kmrs} who give a sociological justification for the central design choice of
  identifying trust with risk. We appreciate the work in TrustDavis \cite{davis}, which proposes a financial trust system with
  transitivity and in which trust is defined as lines-of-credit, similar to us. We extended their work by using the blockchain
  for automated proofs-of-risk, a feature not available to them at the time.

  Our conservative strategy and Transitive Game are similar to the mechanism proposed by Fugger \cite{iou} which is also
  financially transitive and is used by Ripple \cite{ripple} and Stellar \cite{stellar}. IOUs in those correspond to reversed
  edges of trust in our system. The critical difference is that our trust is expressed in a global currency and there is no
  money-as-debt. Furthermore, we proved that trust and maximum flows are equivalent, a direction not explored in their papers,
  even though it seems to hold for their systems as well.
