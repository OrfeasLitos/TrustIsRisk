  This algorithm calls the necessary functions to prepare the new graph.
  \subimport{common/algorithms/}{executeturn.tex}
  The following algorithm validates that the tentative turn produced by the strategy respects the rules imposed on turns.
  If the turn is invalid, an empty turn is returned.
  \subimport{fc17/algorithms/}{validateturn.tex}
  Finally, this algorithm applies the turn to the old graph and returns the new graph, along with the updated capital and
  history.
  \subimport{fc17/algorithms/}{committurn.tex}
  It is straightforward to verify the compatibility of the previous algorithms with the corresponding definitions.
