\section{Mechanics}
  We now trace $Alice$'s steps from joining the network to successfully completing a purchase. Suppose initially all her
  coins, say $10\bitcoin$, are under her exclusive control.

  Two trustworthy friends, $Bob$ and $Charlie$, persuade her to try out Trust Is Risk. She installs the Trust Is Risk wallet
  and migrates the $10\bitcoin$ from her regular wallet, entrusting $2\bitcoin$ to $Bob$ and $5\bitcoin$ to $Charlie$. She now
  exclusively controls $3\bitcoin$. She is risking $7\bitcoin$ to which she has full but not exclusive access in exchange for
  being part of the network.

  A few days later, she discovers an online shoes shop owned by $Dean$, also a member of Trust Is Risk. She finds a nice pair
  of shoes that costs $1\bitcoin$ and checks $Dean$'s trustworthiness through her new wallet. Suppose $Dean$ is deemed
  trustworthy up to $5\bitcoin$. Since $1\bitcoin < 5\bitcoin$, she confidently proceeds to purchase the shoes with her new
  wallet.

  She can then see in her wallet that her exclusive coins have remained $3\bitcoin$, the coins entrusted to $Charlie$ have
  been reduced to $4\bitcoin$ and $Dean$ is entrusted $1\bitcoin$, equal to the value of the shoes. Also, her purchase is
  marked as pending. If she checks her trust towards $Dean$, it still is $5\bitcoin$. Under the hood, her wallet redistributed
  her entrusted coins in a way that ensures $Dean$ is directly entrusted with coins equal to the value of the purchased item
  and that her reported trust towards him has remained invariant.

  Eventually all goes well and the shoes reach $Alice$. $Dean$ chooses to redeem $Alice$'s entrusted coins, so her wallet
  does not show any coins entrusted to $Dean$. Through her wallet, she marks the purchase as successful. This lets the system
  replenish the reduced trust to $Bob$ and $Charlie$, setting the entrusted coins to $2\bitcoin$ and $5\bitcoin$ respectively
  once again. $Alice$ now exclusively owns $2\bitcoin$. Thus, she can now use a total of $9\bitcoin$, which is expected,
  since she had to pay $1\bitcoin$ for the shoes.
